Python skills you need to make better data-driven marketing decisions. In this repository, I will show how to analyze campaign performance, measure customer engagement, and predict customer churn. Working with real-world data, including retail transactions, you'll discover how to analyze social media data, extract insights from text data, and gain market basket analysis skills that will help you better understand your customers. You’ll also use statistical models and machine learning to forecast customer lifetime value. Through hands-on activities, you’ll use popular packages such as pandas, Matplotlib, tweepy, NLTK, seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn to help you improve your company’s marketing strategy. By the end of the projects, you'll be ready to navigate the world of marketing using Python.
